# üïí VHDL Alarm Clock

A digital alarm clock implemented in **VHDL**, designed for synthesis on the **Altera DE1-SoC** FPGA development board.  
This repository contains all essential **VHDL source files**, but not a complete Quartus project setup.  
Users can easily recreate the project by adding these files to a new Quartus project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

This repository contains VHDL code for an alarm clock that:
- Keeps real time (hours and minutes)
- Allows setting an alarm
- Triggers an alarm signal when the current time matches the alarm time
- Displays information on a seven-segment or LCD display

The design uses modular VHDL components for timekeeping, mode selection, display control, and alarm logic.
